# SteamGen

A "simple" steam account generator using the selenium webdriver also has the ability to use proxies, its not finished and I dont really have intentions on finishing it, Im just posting so that you can use it (maybe I'll update if I see that its doing good on github).

## Update!

So I "updated" the generator and it should work better now (keyword: should) im not gonna update it anymore because it is an actual NIGHTMARE to try and make this shit code work, if you want to modify the code go for it I dont really care and tbh im done, and this is mostly because of this shitty code right here:

```python
        s = "----- Steam Account -----"
        u = "Username: " + username
        p = "Password: " + password
        e = "Email: " + email
        d = "-------------------------"
        with open("accounts.txt", "a") as f:
            f.write(s)
            f.write("\n")
            f.write(u)
            f.write("\n")
            f.write(p)
            f.write("\n")
            f.write(e)
            f.write("\n")
            f.write(d)
            f.write("\n")
            f.flush()
            f.close()
```
It just doesn't work, I've tried everything but I can't get it to work if you know what may be causing the error please open an issue and tell me, tysm bye.
